Description: The CommonMark specification defines a rationalized version of markdown
    syntax. This package uses the 'cmark' reference implementation for converting
    markdown text into various formats including html, latex and groff man. In
    addition it exposes the markdown parse tree in xml format. Also includes opt-in
    support for GFM extensions including tables, autolinks, and strikethrough text.
